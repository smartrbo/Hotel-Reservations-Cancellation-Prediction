# Hotel-Reservations-Cancellation-Prediction
Project

The aim of this project to predict the possible reservations that are going to cancelled by the customers by analyzing various features and variables associated with the reservation.

Context
The online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and customersâ€™ behavior. A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.
